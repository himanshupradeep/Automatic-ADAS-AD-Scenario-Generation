Prompt2Scene is an AI powered application I built that transforms plain language descriptions into executable driving scenarios within seconds/minutes. It supports industry-standard formats like **OpenSCENARIO** and **OpenDRIVE**, and integrates with leading simulation environments including **Esmini**, **CarMaker**, **CARLA**, and **AVL Scenario Simulator**.

Whether it's a simple lane-change maneuver or a complex multi-agent urban intersection, Prompt2Scene enables scalable scenario generation for ADAS and autonomous vehicle development, testing, and validation.

## ✨ Example Prompts

> "A pedestrian crosses a two-lane street from right to left while a car approaches at 30 km/h."

> "An ego vehicle follows a slow truck on a highway and performs a lane change to overtake."

> "Two vehicles start at an intersection, one turns left while another comes straight from the opposite side."

## 🎓 Ideal Use Cases

- Scenario-based testing in simulation.
- Academic research in AV safety & planning.
- Dataset generation for machine learning.
- Help visualise an on-road situation to a learner driver.
- Showcasing ADAS logic in interviews or research presentations.
